copy the text in-between the lines:

<lib>
name = universesim
dataset = "Universe Simulation" "Assistant" "humanity" "large detail" "numbers" "ascii art" "narrative" "expansive" "simulation"
temperature = 0.1 - 1
version = 1
creator = triple#5863
</lib>

Keep in mind this is not a high detailed dataset, and doesn't necessarily work well. You would need 20+ words in the dataset for it to be really effective.
